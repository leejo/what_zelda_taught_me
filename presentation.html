# What Zelda Taught Me About Non-Deterministic Polynomial Time Complexity

When you rediscover one of your favourite childhood games

Note: Left = Link, Right = Zelda

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past

--

* First released for The Super Nintendo in late 1991

--

* Played this when i was a kid in 1993, thirty years ago!

--

* I think it took me most of a summer to complete

???

What does completing it require?

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

![:scale 75%](img/linear/01.png)

???

Storm the castle to rescue Zelda

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

![:scale 75%](img/linear/02.png)

???

Collect the three pendants

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

![:scale 75%](img/linear/03.png)

???

To get the master sword to defeat Aga

... Link likes to hold things in the air

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

![:scale 75%](img/linear/04.png)

???

Get transported into the dark world

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

![:scale 75%](img/linear/05.png)

???

Where you collect seven crystals

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

![:scale 75%](img/linear/06.png)

???

Which frees seven maidens

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

![:scale 75%](img/linear/07.png)

???

To break the seal on Ganon's tower

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

![:scale 75%](img/linear/08.png)

???

So you can defeat Ganon

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

![:scale 75%](img/linear/10.png)

???

Saving Hyrule ðŸŽ‰

---

## The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past ("ALTTP")

Simple!

--

* It's a relatively linear game

  * Progression item placement is the same every time

--

* The key: it opens up by you collecting those items

???

Give an example of a progression item (flippers)

--

  * Ergo: the vanilla game has a set route to complete it

--

  * And it's the same route every time you play it

--

* It's possible to play the vanilla game a little out of order

--

* But the vanilla item progression largely restricts that

--

* Some parts of the vanilla game are randomised (RNG dependent):

  * Enemy behaviour

  * Non-progression item drops (life refills, money, consumables)

---

## AGDQ (Awesome Games Done Quick)

--

* Like many games, people started speed running ALTTP

???

where you try to complete the game as quickly as possible

i don't find this very interesting

because it essentially becomes a grind and dependent on RNG (i.e. luck)

--

* Current NMG record is about 1h22m

???

NMG - no major glitches

--

* AGDQ is a charity speed running event

--

* Happens [now] a few times a year

--

* They live stream and later upload videos of the runs to YouTube

--

* First encounter with the randomizer (late 2018?) due to the YouTube algorithm

???

I'd occassionaly watch speed runs out of not-quite-morbid curiosity

like: Final Fantasy VII completed in 7 hours, or something ridiculous like that

the algorithm of course started chucking other AGDQ videos at me

---

## The Randomizer?

--

* A patched version of the game where items are shuffled

--

* There are 216 items in the original game

--

* Shuffling the items changes the possible route through the game

--

* Effectively infinite variations?

--

* The randomizer understands the "logic" of the game

 * It prevents generation of unbeatable games

 * Allows different modes of randomisation

---

## The Randomizer?

--

A patched version of the game might end up with:

* ~~Storm the castle to rescue Zelda~~

--

* ~~Collect the three pendants~~

--

* Get the master sword ~~to defeat Aga~~

--

* Get transported into the dark world

--

* *Maybe* rescue seven maidens to break the seal on Ganon's tower

--

* Climb the tower and defeat Ganon, saving Hyrule ðŸŽ‰

--

* The game is now far less linear

???

because we now only have to complete 7 of 10 dungeons some of the progression items become unnecessary

the randomiser will make them logically accessible, however

if you get those items they could send you on a wild goose chase

---

## The Randomizer (Technicalities)

--

* Originally C#

--

* PHP since 2016 (by initial commit, probably predates that)

--

 * Currently version v31.0.11

 * With v32 in preview

--

* Knows the address space of every item in the game

--

* And the logical requirements to access those items in the game

--

* At first was "simply" randomising items

--

* Now has the option to randomise almost anything:
 * entrances / locations
 * bosses / pots / enemies
 * game mode
 * etc

---

## The Randomizer (Technicalities)

Checkerboard Cave:

![:scale 75%](img/01_checkerboard_cave.png)

???

to give an example of just one location

---

## The Randomizer (Technicalities)

Checkerboard Cave:

![:scale 75%](img/02_checkerboard_cave.png)

???

in the vanilla game this is a heart piece (IIRC)

in the randmoiser it could be anything... almost

it is accessible relatively late in the vanilla game (about 2/3 of the way through)

but this could be accessible within the first few minutes of playing a seed

a seed is the term given to a randomly generated game, of course

---

## The Randomizer (Technicalities)

Checkerboard Cave:

`app/Region/Standard/LightWorld/South.php`:

```php
namespace ALttP\Region\Standard\LightWorld;

...

$this->locations = new LocationCollection([
    ...
    new Location\Standing("Checkerboard Cave", [0x180005], null, $this),
    ...
]);

```

???

On the code side of this

The "location" is actually the address in the rom where the item is

anytime we put something in there we're replacing the data at the referenced address

---

## The Randomizer (Technicalities)

Checkerboard Cave:


```php
$this->locations["Checkerboard Cave"]->setRequirements(
    function ($locations, $items) {

        return $items->canLiftRocks()
        && (
            $items->has('MagicMirror')
            && $this->world->getRegion('Mire')->canEnter($locations, $items)
        );

    }
);
```

???

but we cannot logically put an item in this place if it is required to access this place

so the code has these checks in place for this particular location

(explain the if checks here)

---

## The Randomizer (Technicalities)

Some of these get pretty involved:

```php
$this->locations["Ganon's Tower - Moldorm Chest"]
    ->setRequirements(function ($locations, $items) {

        return $items->has('Hookshot')
        && $items->canShootArrows($this->world)
        && $items->canLightTorches()
        && $items->has('BigKeyA2')
        && $items->has('KeyA2', 4)
        && $this->boss_middle->canBeat($items, $locations)
        && $this->boss_top->canBeat($items, $locations);

    })->setFillRules(function ($item, $locations, $items) {

        return $item != Item::get('KeyA2', $this->world)
            && $item != Item::get('BigKeyA2', $this->world);
    });
```

???

this is the very last chest in the vanilla game

but requirements here are pretty simple as in the vanilla game it is impossible to get to this chest without having obtained every other progression item in the game

---

## The Attraction of The Randomiser

--

* Every new "seed" is a different game

--

* We have about 20 items required to beat the game

--

* And 216 possible locations they can be

--

* We know how to get to those locations

--

* But we want to do it in the optimal order

--

* Sometimes we have interesting routing or logic problems

???

and this is a classic know problem in combinatorial maths / computer science
---

## The Travelling Salesman (i.e. Link)

--

* An NP-hard routing problem

--

* But here it's more complex than that

--

 * Certain areas are only accessible after getting specific items

--

 * And we don't know where those specific items are

--

* Adding known unknows to an NP-hard problem ðŸ¤”

--

* And the route evolves as the items are accessed

--

 * Including dead ends and backtracking ðŸ¤¨

---

## ~~Solving~~ Creating The Route

--

* The fill algorithm (`app/Filler/RandomAssumed.php`):

```php
12 class RandomAssumed extends Filler
13 {
14     /**
15      * This fill places items in the first available location that it
             can possibly be in, assuming that unplaced
16      * items will be reachable. Those items will then have a smaller
             set of places that they can be placed.
17      *
...
24      */
25     public function fill( ... ): void
26     {
...
32         $randomized_order_locations
               = $this->shuffleLocations($all_locations);
...
34         $this->fillItemsInLocations(
               $dungeon,
               $randomized_order_locations,
               ...
           );
```

???

the fill algorithm works as the comment says

fillItemsInLocations is where the heart of the logic lies

which hooks into the previously shown logic of location requirements

---

## ~~Solving~~ Creating The Route

--

* Solving the route? That's the fun: you never know what you're gonna get

---

## Let's Generate a Game...

* With DEBUG enabled to show the fill algorithm in action
